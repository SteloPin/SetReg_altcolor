# SetReg_altcolor
Program to set registery values for key dmd_colorize if altcolor-file exists or is missing.

### Motivation
To setup VPinMAME with colorized DMDs, file pin2dmd.pal has to be copied to the corresponding rom-folder at  
C:\Visual Pinball\VPinMAME\altcolor and VPinMAME has to be configured to use the colorized DMD.  

Here comes SetReg_altcolor into play.

SetReg_altcolor loops through all of your altcolor-files and check, if the VPinMAME-configuration needs to be changed.  
The changes can be made interactive by one klick or in silent mode by using command line parameters.  
More about the usage in the [How it works](https://github.com/SteloPin/SetReg_altcolor/wiki/How-it-works) section.
